# Instructions to Test the SAT/SMT Model

In order to run the script for the simulation, you need Python correctly installed.

Then you need the following libraries: numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, z3-solver. These can be installed by typing in the terminal the following commands:

```
pip install numpy
pip install matplotlib
pip install seaborn
pip install z3-solver
```

The script works by giving it an argument which must be an integer between 8 and 40, which indicates the instance you want to solve. For example, if you want to solve 11x11.txt, you have to write in the terminal placed in the `src` folder:

```
python sat_smt_model.py 11
```

Anytime the script is executed, in the same folder, the file `pwp.txt` containing the solution is generated, and a graphical representation of the solution is shown.

The `general` folder contains the points 5 and 6 of the project, which deal with rotation and rectangles with the same dimension.

I provide also two instances 11 and 12 modified from the originals to test this model. In order to run them, it is sufficient to write in the terminal placed in the `general` folder:

```
python sat_smt_model_rot_same.py 11
python sat_smt_model_rot_same.py 12
```

## Checking Results

You can also run only the function which shows graphically the instances solved. For example, if you want to see the graphical result of 11x11-out.txt, you have to write in the terminal placed in the `src` folder the following commands:

```
python
from show_pwp import show_pwp
show_pwp("../out/11x11-out.txt")
```

Due to the fact that sometimes nearby pieces are represented with the same color, for a further checking, the function `show_pwp` also prints a file called `mat.txt` in the src folder to show with a matrix the exact position of each element.

For a faster checking, I also provide the figures of the solved instances in the `out_figures` folder.
